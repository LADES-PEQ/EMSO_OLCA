# EMSO_OLCA
> The EMSO_OLCA tool was developed in C++ to integrate the life cycle analysis software OpenLCA with the Environment for Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization of Processes ‚Äì EMSO.

Integrating life cycle analysis into the environment for process modeling and simulation is particularly interesting as it allows not only for online emissions monitoring but also for designing equipment based on bioeconomy principles, performing environmental techno-economic assessments of processes, and optimizing processes and control based on environmental metrics.

EMSO is an environment for modeling, simulation, and optimization of processes, free for academic use (SOARES and SECCHI, 2003). It is faster in simulation time compared to commercial simulators, making it suitable for real-time applications. It offers integration with OPC, Python, Matlab, Scilab / OPC / Excel and easy integration with real-time industrial systems (SOARES and SECCHI, 2003).

ABSTRACT = {While there are software tools available for helping to conduct life cycle assessment (LCA), such as OpenLCA, these tools lack integration with process design, simulation, and optimization software. As LCA has a critical role in sustainable product design, this paper presents a platform called EMSO_OLCA, which integrates the LCA provided by OpenLCA into the Environment for Modeling, Simulation, and Optimization (EMSO). EMSO_OLCA incorporates a database of environmental impact assessment methodologies from OpenLCA and aligns with the principles of LCA outlined in ISO 14040 and ISO 14044. Validation tests were conducted to compare the results obtained by the LCA of sugarcane ethanol using OpenLCA and EMSO_OLCA, revealing a high level of agreement. The average relative error was 0.045%, indicating a negligible discrepancy between the tools. Moreover, it took only 0.3 s for the calculation, which is desirable for use with process system engineering tools. A second case study was applied to combined steam and electricity production from the combustion of sugarcane bagasse and straw in a combined heat and power system. The results show the integration of LCA with simulation and sensitivity analysis tools, thus supporting sustainable decision-making processes. EMSO_OLCA bridges the gap between LCA and process engineering, enabling a holistic approach to the sustainability, design, and implementation of environmentally friendly solutions.},
